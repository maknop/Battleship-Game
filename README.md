# Battleship Game

A basic implementation of the popular battleship game played from the terminal. This \n game was created for my final project
choice in CS120 at the University \n of Northern Colorado. 

Functionality includes:
1. Ships place randomly for the player and the computer.
2. Computer generates a random move
3. User input is accepted for player's move. 
4. Winner is determined when all five ships are fully destroyed.
